I was able to test all 3, fork, waitpid and getpid

#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
   int pid = 1;
   int x = 0;
   int butt = fork();
   int butt2 = waitpid(pid, &x, 0);
   int butt3 = getpid();
   printf("Fork Call: %d\n", butt);
   printf("Waitpid Call: %d\n", butt2);
   printf("Getpid Call: %d\n", butt3);
   return 0;
}

Results:

OS/161 kernel [? for menu]: p my-testbin/forkYOU
Fork Call: 1
Waitpid Call: 1
Getpid Call: 1
Operation took 0.167390172 seconds

Woot! I got a bit of help from Peter. I was actually on the right track I was just second guessing my self!
