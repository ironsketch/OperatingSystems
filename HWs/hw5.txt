5.1) Multiprocessing has actual concurrency. This is one actual difference between multiprocessing and multiprogramming. I can't think of a second except timing. A multiprogammed system will be slower since it never can attain true concurrency. Otherwise they both share interleaving as well.

5.3)
	a)
	P1:: x=x-1 (9)
	P2:: x=x-1 (8)
	P1:: x=x+1 (9)
	P2:: x=x+1 (10)

	But what if two instructions are processed on P1? Could that happen?

	b) I feel like I am missing something. I don't understand this question most likely.
	P1:: x=x-1 (9)
	P2:: x=x-1 (8)
	P2:: x=x+1 (9)
	P2:: x is 9
	P2:: x=x-1 (8)
	P1:: x=x+1 (9)
	P1:: x is 9
	P1:: x=x-1 (8)

	5.4) a) You said this one was tricky so i assume my first response is wrong. 100. I looked it up and that is what a website said as well... I'll have to ask for clarification on this.
		 b) Based on my previous thought Nâˆ™50 for an upper bound.
	5.5) My only thought is if a process is suspended and blocked. How much time would that take versus running a process to keep checking. I think it depends on how long the process actually needs to wait versus blocking and unblocking a thread/process.

	5.12) It seems that s.count is only incremented when the queue is empty and decremented if the count is greater than 0. I don't see it getting negative. And it doesn't matter switching them, they'll both work. The number used means nothing as long as it is used right.

	5.19) I need help with this.

	5.21)
