Operating Systems


At first I struggled with where everything was! I had no idea where main.c was or test.h but I just dug and used logic to search where, most likely, they would be. Then as you know I had trouble getting my hello.c file to work. Usually when I don't know something I search the internet. I usually look at between 3 - 10 answers and find the commonality between them. I found most people responded to the error with, void needed to be between (). I also assumed that if it needed to be like that in my hello.c file it needed to match exactly like that in my .h file. So that worked!

This lab was fun because I finally got to really do something in the os. :D
